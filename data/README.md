# data/

This file contain raw data and processed data (daily splitted, cleaned or aggregated). Input for optimize or graphing should be put into output/ instead of this folder.

Note that as the data is contracted, none of them will be included here. 

For local repo, include appropriate .gitignore in this folder so that they won't get accidentally uploaded to Git.
